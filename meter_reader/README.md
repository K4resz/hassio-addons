# Meter Reader

OpenCV and Tesseract OCR based meter reader.

Put a webcam in front of your utility meter, OpenCV and Tesseract OCR classifies the image, and it sends the reading over MQTT server/broker of your choice.

## Usage

Use HA camera proxy integration to crop camera image, if needed.

Create an automation to regularly take a snapshot of your camera image.

(Or use an ESP-CAM to take snapshots at regular intervals.)

Set up and start the addon.

Create an MQTT sensor in HA to subscribe to mqtt topic.
